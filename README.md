A list of things I want to build

- Open epidimiological data project that allows real time tracking of cases of infectious diseases worldwide. Would be accompanied by an app and an API so that health workers could log cases of ebola, malaria, zika, etc. The app would record cases that were spatiotemporally excilit, not aggregated to district or country. Access to the data set would be free and open. A web portal could provide predictive models both vector based and suitability. Focus here is on open data, worldwide scope, and positionally excplicit case data.
- easyClass: A web-based app for cloud-sourced tagging of images and text for use in machine learning. Folks can upload sets of images or tweets or other media and users can subscribe to a project and easily tag each item with a class label. There could be a live connection to twitter or other social media source. Models could be run automatically when new data is tagged. Gamification: earn points for classifying items.
- A D3-based database modeler for psotgres that reads in a SQL file and creates a visual representation.
- Summitscraper: an interactive app that maps the routes on [http://summitpost.org](http://summitpost.org).
- An interactive map of ice sheet height and thickness using vector tiles (3D) to browse glaciation extent through the LIG or longer.
- A card-based system that allows you to make cards for quotes from scientific papers, along with a reference. Users can then drag and drop the cards into piles when organizing their thoughts.

A list of things I want to build

- easyClass: A web-based app for cloud-sourced tagging of images and text for use in machine learning. Folks can upload sets of images or tweets or other media and users can subscribe to a project and easily tag each item with a class label. There could be a live connection to twitter or other social media source. Models could be run automatically when new data is tagged. Gamification: earn points for classifying items.
- A D3-based database modeler for psotgres that reads in a SQL file and creates a visual representation.
- Summitscraper: an interactive app that maps the routes on [http://summitpost.org](http://summitpost.org).
- An interactive map of ice sheet height and thickness using vector tiles (3D) to browse glaciation extent through the LIG or longer.
- A card-based system that allows you to make cards for quotes from scientific papers, along with a reference. Users can then drag and drop the cards into piles when organizing their thoughts.
